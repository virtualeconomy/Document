### Introduction to V Coin Walk Wallet

To store your V Coins, the safest way is to use the official wallet developed by V SYSTEMS and wallets developed by authorized partners of V SYSTEMS.

The V Coin Walk Wallet is co-developed by V SYSTEMS team and Community Developer Walk Bank team. The V Coin Walk Wallet will store the public and private keys encrypted for users. They include both hot and cold wallets, and offer a full-suite of cryptocurrency storage solution.

In the V Coin Walk Wallets, users can use their own V Coins to participate in supernode minting, and earn coin rewards through the Supernode Proof-of-Stake mechanism, similar to coin mining.

### V Coin Hot Wallet and Cold Wallet
V Coin Walk Wallets are divided into hot wallet and cold wallet. As a quick breakdown, hot wallet refers to the real-time network wallet, which allows easy and quick transaction. Cold wallets, on another hand, are designed for maintaining the complete safety of V Coins and are therefore disconnected from the network. They are only opened when signatures are granted.

A hot wallet is connected to the network in real time, which is convenient for users to carry out various actions in a quick manner, including coin transfer, coin collection, coin leasing, and participation in airdrops. Apart from that, hot wallet is the only medium to initiate the operation of cold wallet. In other words, a cold wallet must be associated or connected to a hot wallet in order for any actions to be performed in the cold wallet, such as managing and viewing coins.

A cold wallet is disconnected from the network at all times, except when a signature is presented, by which users can then perform different actions to the cold wallet through the hot wallet. That is, if a user wishes to operate commands to a cold wallet through the hot wallet interface, a cold wallet-generated private key signature is required by the blockchain. It is strongly advised that the cold wallet private key and keywords that generate private keys are kept secure, so that signatures cannot be forged by unauthorized parties, and V Coins can remain absolutely safe. A friendly reminder to users who own a large amount of V Coins that cold wallets are suggested for storage as they ensure a high level of security.

Hot wallet and cold wallet are two separate wallets, each with a set of private key and public key. To make viewing and operation easier, users can connect a cold wallet to a hot wallet through the hot wallet interface. By “connecting”, it does not imply that the cold wallet is linked to the network, cold wallets therefore still remain safe.
