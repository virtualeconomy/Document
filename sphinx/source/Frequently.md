### What is V SYSTEMS' Sidechain Mode?
Mainchain-Sidechain Model The platform introduces its own model for mainchain and sidechain. A blockchain S is called a sidechain of another blockchain M, the mainchain, if S satisfies: 
* Awareness: full nodes of S are also full nodes of M and process the entire blockchain of M
* Synchronization: S observes abstract clock synchronization to M

Abstract clock synchronization deals with the ordering of blocks between the two blockchains. Imagine the blockchain as an abstract clock, whereof each block in the chain is a clock tick. It is called abstract as it has nothing to do with the local timestamps written into the blocks. Timestamps are local values that cannot determine the correct ordering of events globally. Instead, block number inside blockchain can determine a global time sequence. Observers can safely say events in a previous block always happen before events in a later block regardless of their timestamps.

When a sidechain block is generated, it links to the latest mainchain block as its mainchain parent. Multiple consecutive sidechain blocks are allowed to share the same mainchain block as their mainchain parent. This mainchain-sidechain parent-child relationship must also be order-preserving.

This model of mainchain-sidechain allows us to develop a proprietary communication method between the two blockchains. Unlike Blockstream’s proposal, our model does not require pegging on sidechains, thus giving sidechain projects much more freedom to innovate.
### What Is V SYSTEMS' Cloud Developing and Modular Design?
Cloud & Modular = Easy Deployment

The V SYSTEMS platform will be both easy to use and developer-friendly through modular development functions and cloud platform tools which enable enterprise developers to focus on doing business on the blockchain, rather than grappling with difficult coding issues.

Core blockchain database functions such as consensus management, block tree management, interchain processing, transaction processing, data formats, peer networks, and internet protocols will be constructed as independent templates or building blocks.

Developers focusing on how the blockchain is applied to their particular business logic will combine these building blocks to create numerous iterations of blockchain functionality that suit their requirements. Users will be able to modify their database by choosing different protocol parameters and pluggable components. From the blockchain developer’s perspective, this greatly improves overall development efficiency and guarantees stability from the outset.
### What Is V SYSTEMS' Blockchain Database?
Blockchain Databases = Multiple Purposes

Key to Sunny King’s vision is the idea that scalable, cost-efficient blockchains can power decentralised databases, revolutionising the way businesses can be run. V SYSTEMS is working on providing the world’s first full-featured blockchain database for storing object-oriented data.

Blockchain-based databases can support more complex applications, such as financial, gaming, social and other application scenarios that depend on databases’ storage and organisational abilities. Databases on blockchains will have high concurrency, the capacity for customisation, efficient indexing, data security and a host of other desirable application scenarios.

All of these applications will become faster, more flexible and easily scalable when they can be run on dedicated blockchains. Sunny King and the team at V SYSTEMS have already mapped out and started delivering key aspects of database functionalities to run on blockchains — with more to come.
### How Can You Store VSYS Coins?
V SYSTEMS Mainnet provides hot wallet and cold wallet for best security solution to store VSYS Coins.

### What Is the Roadmap of V SYSTEMS 2019-2020?
Further major tasks for V SYSTEMS in the backlog for 2019 roadmap are: support for object oriented database transactions, privacy, smart contract platform, SDK for enterprise Dapps and top of that a decentralized mobile internet network. All in all a quite comprehensive ecosystem for blockchain infrastructure and applications once implemented.
With the underlying foundation of the SPoS-enabled net now running, the next step is to create an application development platform, a set of quick, easy-to-use development tools, a stable and secure smart contract, features that support future enterprise applications, and the basis of mobile-enabled blockchains. The five important milestones VEE has released for next year are aimed to provide these core requirements.
1. Blockchain full-featured databases and cloud development
Blockchain-based databases can support more complex applications, such as financial, gaming, social and other application scenarios that depend on databases’ storage and organisational abilities. Databases on blockchains will have high concurrency, the capacity for customisation, efficient indexing, data security and a host of other desirable application scenarios.
2. Platform and modular design
Core blockchain database functions such as consensus management, block tree management, interchain processing, transaction processing, data formats, peer networks, and internet protocols will be constructed as independent templates or building blocks.
3. The stable and safe smart contract
The VEE native blockchain will support the next generation of smart contracts through facilities for non-fungible assets, registered assets, implementation verification requirements for different situations, and support for more complex situations. More information on how VEE will industrialise smart contracts will be made available during 2019.
4. Enterprise DAPP Support
The VEE native blockchain platform will fully implement Enterprise Decentralised Application (DAPP) support with a full privacy protection layer for smart contracts, databases, and cloud development on mobile devices. An Enterprise DAPP’s back-end code will run on VEE’s decentralised peer-to-peer network, unlike conventional apps whose back-end code runs on centralised servers.
5. Decentralized mobile internet
The modern economy depends more and more on mobile-based applications for commerce, gaming, social media and communication. The roadmap introduces the innovative concept of the blockchain-enabled MAPP (Mobile APP): the VEE team will combine blockchain technology and mobile internet offerings to create a new decentralised mobile internet network with browser support for mobile phone users, simplifying blockchain operations in mobile internet applications. We are working on applying blockchain traits such as data synchronisation and integrity to several existing mobile phone operating systems.
### What Exchange Does VSYS Coin List?
V SYSTEMS has listed its VSYS Coin for trading on Bitfinex, KuCoin and BitForex, three of the world’s leading cryptocurrency trading platforms. The listing provides a great starting point to build up the liquidity of VSYS Coin. It also opens up possibilities for participation in the development, governance and future direction of the network and its innovative features and functionality as the latest revolutionary Supernode Proof of Stake (SPoS) project.
### How Can You Participant the Supernode Minting?
What you may not know is that V SYSTEMS has a coin, VSYS Coin, already running on the platform. It’s the lifeblood of the VSYSTEMS concept. VSYS Coins are now being used to pay various transaction fees on the V SYSTEMS platform, including the Supernode application fee. VSYS Coin holders can also lease VSYS Coins to Supernodes for coin minting, giving them a steady source of revenue as a return on their investment (ROI).
Within this system, participants receive minting ROI, participate in developing a stable, secure coin ecosystem, and the potential for deeper and more rewarding participation in future.
### What is Supernode Minting?
The supernodes also carry out block-minting activities at a predictable rate. The core of SPoS consensus mechanism, based on the cold minting technology, enables Supernodes as the minting pool in the minting economy to generate blocks by receiving coins leased from VSYS Coin holders. Unlike Bitcoin and other PoS, Supernodes in the SPoS system could be completely decentralized, and build a decent ecosystem where Supernodes and coin holders co-exist with balance.
New VSYS Coins are generated from Supernode minting at a fixed inflation rate of 5.5% every year, the economic expansion V SYSTEMS’ ecosystem is more predictable and more stable.
### What is SPoS?
SPoS is the evolution from Proof of Work consensus to Supernode Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus. Being based on high-performance nodes, SPoS will enable a huge rise in the speed, scalability and security of blockchain tech against a 51% attack. V SYSTEMS mainnet of 15 supernodes has been up and running since September with a high degree of resilience and industrial-level TPS — so it is speeding ahead to the next stages. 
The supernodes also carry out block-minting activities at a predictable rate — currently four seconds, but this will speed up as the network expands. This gives the network an extremely stable foundation, helping with scalability and performance — essential for commercial applications. Participants who maintain the supernodes which carry out minting activities will be incentivized with greater voting power in consensus decisions. The supernode-based network will provide the bedrock on which the mass of functional blockchains will run.
SPoS has a major effect in moving V SYSTEMS toward its vision to overcome blockchain technology’s current barriers to entry, essentially freeing it up for use by masses of users — cost-efficiently, developer-friendly, and of course secure. Because the key activity of consensus will be untethered from power consumption, it becomes much less power-hungry and therefore much less expensive.
### What is V SYSTEMS?
V SYSTEMS (also known as VSYS) is a blockchain project led by the legendary blockchain developer Sunny King, creator of Proof of Stake consensus. V SYSTEMS offers a solution that re-architects blockchain using Supernode Proof of Stake (SPoS) and a modular structure to bring truly scalable and stable blockchain.
### Full Node related question
#### 1. My full node program is crashed. How to make the node stable?

**Answer:** Please check the log. If it is caused by out of memory, we suggest you increase your RAM. The standard requirement is 16G. For more hardware requirement, please refer to [this part](https://github.com/virtualeconomy/v-systems/wiki/Instructions-for-Exchanges#hardware).

#### 2. Any security issue should exchange pay attention?

**Answer:** The **api-key-hash** in config should set to your own password, not using the default hash. And we suggest the exchange modify firewall rule and **not open 9922 in public** network, only for internal network using.

### Swagger & cURL related question
#### 1. When I called API, I got "Provided API key is not correct" error. How can I solve it?

**Answer:** Firstly, make sure the full node you connect is owned by you. Then you should have set the api-key-hash in config (reference [here](https://github.com/virtualeconomy/v-systems/wiki/Instructions-for-Exchanges#step-2-configuration)). If configure well, remember your orginal API key. 

For swagger, input your API key in top bar and click "Explore". 

For curl, pass your API key in HTTP header. For instance,

```shell
$ curl -X GET --header 'api_key: <your api key>' 'http://<full node ip>:9922/wallet/seed'
```

#### 2. Why I always got "The server was not able to produce a timely response to your request. Please try again in a short while!" error with HTTP repsonse 503?

**Answer:** Currently, we only support JSON for interaction. Please check HTTP header. In HTTP header, the "Accept" should be “application/json”, not "text/plain" or any other value.

#### 3. I got "The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future" error with HTTP repsonse 404. How can I solve it?

**Answer:** Make sure call method (GET/POST) is correct. The curl default method is GET. Remember to add "-X GET" or "-X POST" behind curl command.

#### 4. When I call POST /addresses to create account, where is the wallet data store?

**Answer:** In your configuration file, you should have set the **directory**:

```
# V Systems node settings
vsys {
  # Path Settings
  directory = <block data folder path>
  ......
```
Then, all accounts data will store in ```<block data folder path>/wallet/wallet.dat``` file. It would better to backup this file in scheduled task.

### Pyvsys related question
#### 1. When I create API wrapper, how to fill the API key field?

**Answer:** Just left API key field empty. Like this,

```python
import pyvsys as pv
my_wrapper = pv.create_api_wrapper('http://<full node ip>:9922', api_key='')
```
Just for payment, API key is not required. Because pyvsys will broadcast the payment with signature which signed by account private key.

#### 2. I always get "Failed to get balance detail". How to solved it?

**Answer:** First of all, test the following code:

```
# For Testnet testing
import pyvsys as pv
chain = pv.testnet_chain()
acc = Account(chain=chain)
print(acc.get_info())
```

```
# For Mainnet testing
import pyvsys as pv
node = pv.create_api_wrapper('https://wallet.vee.tech/api', api_key='')
chain = pv.Chain(chain_name='mainnet', chain_id='M', address_version=5, api_wrapper=node)
acc = Account(chain=chain)
print(acc.get_info())
```

If it works, please check your previous code. Otherwise, it should be network issue. Please check the network.

### Balance & Payment related question
#### 1. When I check balance, I get a lot of field like 'regular', 'available', 'effective', 'mintingAverage'. Which field is the actual final balance?

**Answer:** The ```available``` balance is the actual balance which account currently could use.

#### 2. What is the minimum transaction fee?

**Answer:** The mininum transaction fee is 10000000(0.1 VSYS). 

#### 3. How to fill fee scale field?

**Answer:** In current version, the fee scale is a fixed value. It should be 100.

#### 4. How many block should we wait for a transaction to be final?

**Answer:** The waiting blocks should be **M * super_node_num + 1** (M = max accept waiting minutes since transaction sent). The greater confirmations you wait, the less false confirm in chain case will be occurred. Currently, super node num is 15. So we suggest the waiting blocks are more than 15. For example, if you just sent a transaction and you could wait 2 minutes to confirm the transaction in chain, then waiting blocks should be 2*15+1=31.
